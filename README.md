### Hi there my name is Roberto

I am a **Bionics Engineer** currently pursuing a **Master's in Systems Engineering**. I'm fascinated by the intersection of hardware, software, and how technology impacts human life styles.

My current focus is on **Social Robotics** and the relationship between humans and technology.

- **Currently working on:**
  - **H.E.R.B.I.E.:** A social robot designed for plant care based on *Weak Robotics* principles.
  - **My Digital Garden:** Building a personal knowledge management system using Obsidian and Quartz.
